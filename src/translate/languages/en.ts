        I'm a front-end developer with a lifelong affinity for technology. I started programming in high school and have been working professionally in the field since 2021, turning this interest into a career 💻

        Throughout my academic journey, I excelled in projects, presentations, and competitions, frequently ranking among the top students in my class. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from UFC – CE, with a Summa Cum Laude 🎓 graduation.

        I work as a front-end engineer, focusing on ReactJS, developing high-performance, well-structured, and easy-to-maintain interfaces. I also have experience with Next.js, Node.js, and React Native, which broadens my product vision ⚛️

        I am proactive, organized, and results-oriented, with good communication skills and a strong sense of responsibility. I come from the interior of Ceará, I'm a football enthusiast, and I'm always seeking professional and personal growth 🎯
